👋 Hi, I’m @Sigmozaur

👀 I’m interested in quantum physics, biology, and software testing.

🌱 I’m currently learning quantum physics and biology/chemistry, using AI as a learning tool.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting game projects, especially those involving advanced NPC behaviors.

📫 How to reach me: Message me here on GitHub/ tiktok - Sigmozaur/Sigmozaurrr.

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I love DMC game series and anime bcz of potencial to learn.
⚡ Fun fact: I dedicate all my free time to studying biology and physics. In October, I plan to start part-time medical studies (weekends) while working full-time from Monday to Friday.
⚡My biggest dream is to have access to real lab/ real powerful PC ;D.
